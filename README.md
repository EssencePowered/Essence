Essence is a Sponge plugin that allows you to quickly start your server with essential commands, events, and other
tidbits that you might need. Extremely configurable, only loading up the modules you want (and providing a way for
plugins to disable modules that they replace the functionality of), and providing a simple and rich API, Essence is an
elite plugin for providing simple server tasks.
 
...or so I hope, soon! With a website full of documentation and everything (at http://quickstart.dualspiral.co.uk/)!
I'm only just getting this off the ground as Sponge has started to stabilise!

Essence currently provides:

* Warps
* Homes
* Teleports (needs to be tested!)
* Kicks
* Bans
* Jails
* Mutes
* Messages
* Mails
* Seen
* Time
* Weather
* Broadcasts
* Fly
* Healing and Feeding
* AFK

...some of which have the ability for warmups and cooldowns to take place, as well as charging users.

## Prerequisites
* [Java] 8
* [Git]

## Cloning
1. `git clone git@github.com:EssencePowered/Essence.git`
2. `cd Essence`
3. `cp scripts/pre-commit .git/hooks`

## Building
#### Notes
1. If you do not have Gradle installed then use ./gradlew for Unix systems or Git Bash and gradlew.bat for Windows
systems in place of any 'gradle' command.

In order to build Essence, simply run the `gradle` command. You will find the compiled JAR named similar to
`Essence-x.x.x.jar` in `builds/libs/`
