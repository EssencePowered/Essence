# Important Note

The death message module had a faulty config check where setting `enable-death-messages` to `true` would actually hide the messages, while setting this to `false` would show them. This has been fixed in this version - you may need to change this config setting if you use this module. 

# Bug Fixes

* (API) Fixed `WarpCategoryData#getDisplayName()` incorrectly returning `null` when a specific display name is not set (thanks to SettingDust for fixing that) 
* Fixed death message module doing the opposite of the `enable-death-messages` 
* Fixed `/teleport` tab completion not working properly when an empty string is tab completed
* Fixed `/teleport` not respecting the `-f` flag when teleporting to offline players
* Fixed `/getpos` not sending a message to the invoking player if it is being used on a player other than self
* Fixed powertools so that they work again
* Ensure that warmup exemption permissions are respected in commands that delay the warmup (such as tpa).
